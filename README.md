# MongoDB_Project_Analysis
This repository showcases a comprehensive MongoDB project designed to illustrate the various functionalities and capabilities of MongoDB through a structured approach. It contains files related to the MongoDB project based on Concert Venue Log (fictional) data. The project demonstrates the use of MongoDB for CRUD operations and the Aggregation Framework.

## Project Structure

- **Initial Data File**: 
  - `Msc2023_InitialData_CVL_E_Kennedy.xls`: Excel sheet containing 1000 rows of sample data.
- **JSON Data File**: 
  - `Msc2023_JSON_Master_CVL_E_Kennedy.xls`: Excel sheet formatted for JSON import.
  - `Msc2023_CVL_E_Kennedy.json`: JSON file ready for MongoDB import.
- **Screencasts**:
  - [Screencast 1: Aggregation Framework](https://youtu.be/m097GHKz8U8?si=SdK3UBBwKbsId9JU)
  - [Screencast 2: Aggregation Framework/Atlas](https://youtu.be/O8g4IbTdduk?si=LoDpk1hTV8iN3Bnl)
- **Reports**: 
  - `MongoDB_Report_CVL_E_Kennedy.doc`: Detailed project report in Word format.
  - `MongoDB_Report_CVL_E_Kennedy.pdf`: PDF version of the project report.

## Project Overview

This project is a self-guided learning experience using MongoDB-based implementation for a CVL dataset. It showcases the following:
1. **Data Import**: The collection was populated with 1000 documents, featuring arrays and embedded documents to highlight MongoDB's NoSQL capabilities.
2. **CRUD Operations**: A series of queries were written to demonstrate data retrieval and exploration.
3. **Aggregation Framework**: Complex data analysis using MongoDB's aggregation pipelines.
4. **MongoDB Compass & Atlas**: The project data was also explored using MongoDB Compass and Atlas for visual querying.

## How to Use

1. **Importing Data**: Use the provided `.json` file to import the data into a MongoDB collection.
2. **Running Queries**: The Word/PDF reports provide a list of queries and their expected outputs.
3. **Screencasts**: Watch the screencasts to see how the project data was handled using MongoDBâ€™s Aggregation Framework and other tools.
